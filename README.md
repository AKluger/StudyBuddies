# Study Buddies

### This is a web app for the purpose of helping students streamline the process of organizing study meetups.

* User will fill out a form with name, location, and how long they would like to study for
* Upon form submission, the user will see a map of their fellow students and current location, as well as a table of the  students to choose to meetup with arranged according to distance.
* Upon choosing a classmate to meet with, a new map will populate with study spots (cafes) between the two users and the option to open Slack for communicating


#### Technologies Used

* Javascript
* jQuery
* HTML/CSS
* Twitter Bootstrap
* Firebase
* APIs (TomTom, Geocodio, Yelp)
* Moment.js


#### Fun Features

* Form validation to ensure that the user has filled in all fields and address is valid for API queries
* User location data is erased from the server when their submitted time of availability has expired

#### More to Come

* this app was originally the creation of a four-person team.  The original repo can be found at https://github.com/AKluger/Project-One
* I am tweaking the design of the app, the look of the app, and the underlying technologies to create a more robust product
* Node.js will be implemented to secure API keys and user data
* a new map API will replace TomTom, and potentially Yelp will be swapped for google locations.
